1.Initialization:

A array named "arr" is defined with a size that can be adjusted as needed.
Variables "i," "j," and "temp" of type integer are defined for use in the program.
2.Input Data:

The program reads the numbers you want to sort and stores them in the "arr" array.
3.Executing the Insertion Sort Algorithm:

The program begins executing the Insertion Sort algorithm at the line "for i := 2 to 10 do," starting from the second element in the array.
It compares the current element (temp) with the elements in the sorted region (the elements that have already been sorted) starting from the last element in the sorted region (j) and moving leftward.
If the current element (temp) is smaller than the element in the sorted region, it shifts the element in the sorted region to the right to make space for the current element.
This process is repeated until the correct position for the current element is found, and it is inserted into the sorted array.
4.Printing the Array After Sorting:

After the Insertion Sort algorithm is completed, the program prints the "arr" array after the sorting process.
The work performed by this program helps arrange and sort an array of numbers in ascending order.
